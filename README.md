# Genome-Analysis-
Developed a Python program that imports a custom sequenceAnalysis module for genomic data analysis. The program reads DNA sequences via STDIN, processes them using the FastAreader class, and outputs detailed summaries, including sequence length, GC content, and codon usage statistics. Implemented the NucParams class within the module to calculate codon frequencies and amino acid compositions. The output is formatted to meet precise specifications, ensuring accuracy and clarity in data presentation.
